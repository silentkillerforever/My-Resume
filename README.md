# My-Resume
My personal Resume for applying jobs 2021 


I've created my own resume using Adobe XD tool. It just took 2 hours to complete the entire design. 
Importing images and designs is too smooth on Adobe XD as we can drag and drop them in no time.
It is one of the best UI/UX design tools for beginners and free for all. One can design a websites, wireframes, UI for android and IOS apps and mane more.
One can easily understand the tool in a very quick time.
