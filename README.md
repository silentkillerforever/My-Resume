My personal Resume for applying jobs 2021 


I've created my own resume using Adobe XD tool. It just took 2 hours to complete the entire design. 
Importing images and designs is too smooth on Adobe XD as we can drag and drop them in no time.
It is one of the best UI/UX design tools for beginners and free for all. One can design a websites, wireframes, UI for android and IOS apps and mane more.
One can easily understand the tool in a very quick time.

After designing the entire resume, we can export the file into pdf, png or jpeg format.
I've downloaded the file into pdf file as many of the companies ask the pdf format. But there are some limitations in the software. We have only 2 free pdf exports. If we upgrade our plan, then we can export as many pdfs as we can.
